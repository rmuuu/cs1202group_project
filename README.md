## Description
 The project entitled: CO2 Intel aims to calculate the user’s carbon footprint. It is technically the amount of greenhouse gases produced by a certain user, expressed in units of carbon dioxide. Daily life activities such as foods we consume, electrical use, travel (by car, plane, jeep, and more), consumption of other products and services are some of the factors that help in determining the amount of carbon footprint.
 This program asks the user’s monthly electric consumption, monthly gas bill, yearly mileage on car, number of flights the user had taken in the past year, and  if the user recycles newspaper, aluminum and tin. After obtaining such information, the program will display  the total carbon footprint of the user. Then, it will determine if the computed carbon footprint is ideal otherwise,  if the calculated amount is relatively high suggestions of ways to reduce carbon footprint will be displayed.
