# Topic: Renewable Manager : Title: OmniEnergy
    
## :bulb: Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy derived from natural resources that are replenished more quickly than they are used up is referred to as renewable energy. Sources of this clean energy also called renewables, are known to boost the displacement of “dirty” fossil fuels in the electricity industry, bringing the benefit of fewer emissions of carbon and other types of pollution. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are forms of generating renewable energy, however, this renewable manager will focus only on distributed energy resources (DERs), specifically, solar panels (Solar energy). Solar energy systems don’t produce air pollutants or greenhouse gases, they generate power using mirrors to concentrate sunlight across solar cells. Additionally, they are affordable and often the cheapest form of electricity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when switching to renewable energy, it is a must to track the energy generated and consumption to ensure its performance, and this is OmniEnergy's task. 

## :mag_right: Objectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a clean energy future, OmniEnergy advocates the use of renewables and other clean energy source. :fallen_leaf: :sun_with_face:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives include the following: 
+ To determine the user's energy consumption :electric_plug:
+ To calculate the amount of energy used after solar installation. :zap:
+ To recommend a more effective strategy to cut back on energy use. :house_with_garden:


## :four_leaf_clover: SDG (Affordable and Clean Energy) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition from fossil fuels to generation of renewable energy is encouraged during the present time as it is the key to address the climate crisis. :key: :deciduous_tree: :leaves:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to addressing the climate crisis is energy. When fossil fuels are used to produce energy, including electricity and heat, a significant portion of the greenhouse gases that cover the Planet and trap solar energy are produced.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With over 75% of all greenhouse gas emissions and almost 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions coming from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, these fuels are by far the biggest cause of climate change in the world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The science is clear and concise: emissions must be cut in half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050 in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change. In order to achieve this, we must stop relying on fossil fuels and start putting money into reliable, clean, accessible, and cost-effective alternative energy sources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth are all abundant sources of renewable energy that replenish themselves naturally with little to no air pollution or greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.
