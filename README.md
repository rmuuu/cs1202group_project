# Topic: Carbon Counter: Title
    
## Description
CO2 Intel(?) aims to calculate the userâ€™s carbon footprint. It is technically the amount of greenhouse gases produced by a certain user, expressed in units of carbon--: dioxide. Daily life activities such as foods we consume, electrical use, travel (by car, plane, jeep, and more), consumption of other products and services are some of the factors that help in determining the amount of carbon footprint.:walking: :leaves: 

This project will need the user's information on:
+ monthly electric consumption bill :fuelpump:
+ monthly gas bill :fuelpump:
+ yearly mileage on car :oncoming_automobile:
+ number of flights the user had taken in the past year (4 hours or less, 4 hours or more):airplane:
+ if the user recycles newspaper :newspaper:
+ if the user recycles aluminum and tin :fork_and_knife:

After obtaining such information, the program will display the total carbon footprint of the user. Then, it will determine if the computed carbon footprint is ideal otherwise, if the calculated amount is relatively high suggestions of ways to reduce carbon footprint will be displayed.
