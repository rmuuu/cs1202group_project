# Topic: Renewable Manager : Title: OmniEnergy
    
## :bulb: Description
The energy derived from natural resources that are replenished more quickly than they are used up is referred to as renewable energy. Sources of this clean energy also called renewables, are known to boost the displacement of “dirty” fossil fuels in the electricity industry, bringing the benefit of fewer emissions of carbon and other types of pollution. 

OmniEnergy will solely focus on the renewable energy source: solar energy. Solar energy systems don’t produce air pollutants or greenhouse gases, they generate power using mirrors to concentrate sunlight across solar cells. Additionally, they are affordable and often the cheapest form of electricity.
